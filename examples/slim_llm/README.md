# Slim LLM Example

This directory has two versions of the same LLM workflow:

```text
start -> llm -> answer
```

## Files

- `graph.yml`: the DSL graph
- `dsl.py`: imports `graph.yml` and streams response events with `ResponseStreamFilter`
- `code.py`: builds the graph with Python code
- `settings.py`: shared credentials and Slim setup
- `credentials.example.json`: credentials template
- `credentials.json`: your local credentials

## Prepare

```bash
cd examples/slim_llm
cp credentials.example.json credentials.json
```

Fill in `credentials.json`.

## DSL Import

```bash
python3 dsl.py
python3 dsl.py "Reply with only the word Graphon."
```

## Code Construction

```bash
python3 code.py
python3 code.py "Reply with only the word Graphon."
```

The Python construction example uses `graphon.dsl.slim.SlimLLM` as the standard
Slim-backed LLM runtime. Configure it with the Slim client settings, plugin ID,
provider, model name, and credentials. Optional completion parameters can be
supplied by the Python construction when needed.

For local mode, keep `slim.mode` as `local`. Put `dify-plugin-daemon-slim` in
`PATH`, set `SLIM_BINARY_PATH`, or place a `slim` binary in this directory.

For remote mode, set `slim.mode` to `remote`, then fill in `daemon_addr` and
`daemon_key`.

`credentials.json` is local-only and should not be committed.
